# breakout-backend

This is the backend application for BreakOut. 

# What is BreakOut?
With BreakOut we challenge you to travel as far away as possible in 36 hours without spending any money, starting from Munich. During this time each team collects money for the DAFI-program to give refugees the opportunity of higher education.
More information at http://www.break-out.org

# Test the backend
The newest dev build of this application is always deployed to http://breakout-development.herokuapp.com

In the future a stable master version will be deployed on Heroku as well.

# API
The API documentation is done automatically using [swagger](http://swagger.io) and [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox) and is shown under ["/swagger-ui.html"](http://breakout-development.herokuapp.com) of the corresponding deployed version
